### 1 THUS THE heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

### 2 And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. [[Hebrews 4#9 So then there is still awaiting a full and complete Sabbath-rest reserved for the true people of God|Heb. 4:9]], [[Hebrews 4#10 For he who has once entered God's rest also has ceased from the weariness and pain of human labors just as God rested from those labors peculiarly His own Gen 2 2|10]]


### 3 And God blessed (spoke good of) the seventh day, set it apart as His own, and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all His work which He had created and done. [[Exodus 20#11 For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them and rested the seventh day That is why the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it set it apart for His purposes|Exod. 20:11]]

### 4 This is the history of the heavens and of the earth when they were created. In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens–

### 5 When no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not [yet] caused it to rain upon the earth and there was no man to till the ground,

### 6 But there went up a mist (fog, vapor) from the land and watered the whole surface of the ground–

### 7 Then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath or spirit of life, and man became a living being. [[1 Corinthians 15#45 Thus it is written The first man Adam became a living being an individual personality the last Adam Christ became a life-giving Spirit restoring the dead to life Gen 2 7|I Cor. 15:45-49]]

### 8 And the Lord God planted a garden toward the east, in Eden [delight]; and there He put the man whom He had formed (framed, constituted).

### 9 And out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight or to be desired–good (suitable, pleasant) for food; the tree of life also in the center of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of [the difference between] good and evil and blessing and calamity. [[Revelation 2#7 He who is able to hear let him listen to and give heed to what the Spirit says to the assemblies churches To him who overcomes is victorious I will grant to eat of the fruit of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God Gen 2 9 3 24|Rev. 2:7]]; [[Revelation 22#14 Blessed happy and to be envied are those who cleanse their garments that they may have the authority and right to approach the tree of life and to enter through the gates into the city Gen 2 9 3 22 24|22:14]], [[Revelation 22#19 And if anyone cancels or takes away from the statements of the book of this prophecy these predictions relating to Christ's kingdom and its speedy triumph together with the consolations and admonitions or warnings pertaining to them God will cancel and take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the city of holiness purity and hallowedness which are described and promised in this book|19]]

### 10 Now a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four [river] heads.

### 11 The first is named Pishon; it is the one flowing around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.

### 12 The gold of that land is of high quality; bdellium (pearl?) and onyx stone are there.

### 13 The second river is named Gihon; it is the one flowing around the whole land of Cush.

### 14 The third river is named Hiddekel [the Tigris]; it is the one flowing east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

### 15 And the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to tend and guard andkeep it.

### 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;

### 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and blessing and calamity you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.

### 18 Now the Lord God said, It is not good (sufficient, satisfactory) that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper meet (suitable, adapted, complementary) for him.

### 19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every [wild] beast and living creature of the field and every bird of the air and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatever Adam called every living creature, that was its name.

### 20 And Adam gave names to all the livestock and to the birds of the air and to every [wild] beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper meet (suitable, adapted, complementary) for him.

### 21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and while he slept, He took one of his ribs or a part of his side and closed up the [place with] flesh.

### 22 And the rib or part of his side which the Lord God had taken from the man He built up and made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.

### 23 Then Adam said, This [creature] is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of a man.

### 24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall become united and cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. [[Matthew 19#5 And said For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united firmly joined inseparably to his wife and the two shall become one flesh Gen 1 27 2 24|Matt. 19:5]]; [[1 Corinthians 6#16 Or do you not know and realize that when a man joins himself to a prostitute he becomes one body with her The two it is written shall become one flesh Gen 2 24|I Cor. 6:16]]; [[Ephesians 5#31 For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh Gen 2 24|Eph. 5:31-33]]

### 25 And the man and his wife were both naked and were not embarrassed or ashamed in each other's presence.
